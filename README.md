# Bazzite With Kodi

A custom Bazzite OS image that seamlessly integrates Kodi with Steam's Gaming Mode. Features the KodiLauncher DeckyLoader plugin which adds a dedicated Kodi button to Steam's main navigation menu, enabling users to instantly switch between Kodi and Steam's gaming UI.

## Overview

This project enhances Bazzite by adding:
- **Kodi With HDR Support**: Full HDR media playback using GBM backend
- **Seamless Mode Switching**: Instant transitions between Kodi and GameMode
- **Steam UI Integration**: DeckyLoader plugin - [KodiLauncher](https://github.com/Blahkaey/KodiLauncher) which adds a button to the main navigation menu

## Installation

### Switch from an Existing Universal Blue System
If you're already running a Universal Blue derived image (Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, etc.), you can switch to this image:

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/blahkaey/bazzite-kodi:latest
```

## Quick Start

**Note: Deckyloader and KodiLauncher are installed on first boot of Bazzite-Kodi, a reboot is required to see the kodi button in the Steam UI**
